Domination Modification for Teeworlds
=====================================

*Domination* is a team-based modifcation for *Teeworlds*. You can find 
all relevant information about Teeworlds below. Domination introduces the new 
game element *Domination Spot*. Each map can have up to 5 of them.
Domination Spots are initially neutral, but can be captured by any team. 
Their effect on scoring varies for the different gametypes included. 

You can find all relevant information about the gametypes, server setup, custom maps and more [in the projects wiki](https://github.com/teeworlds-domination/domination/wiki). Please visit the [Teeworlds.com Forum - Topic](https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=122655) for community generated content.

Currently this mod is being developed by *Slayer* and *Fisico*. [Originally](https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3289) it was 
written by *ziltoide* and *Oy*.
